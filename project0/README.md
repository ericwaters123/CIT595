I am hoping that this class will help me better apply what I have learned throughout my time in the MCIT program. In a somewhat unusual course path, CIT5950 is actually my last class of the program. I think that getting more familiar with Git and Docker will be useful when I need to produce code in a workplace environment. Since I have barely used Git before, and have never used Docker, I am excited to improve my skills with them and get more comfortable using them.
